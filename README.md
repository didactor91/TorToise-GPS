For the **non simulated tracker** (LP: 3GLIVE-DEMO and **SN: 9170845958**), currently located in Lleida, if you want **to see a route in time, it was active on 07/15/2019 at 10:50 until that time same day at 11:15. If you select a time zone that includes part or all of that time interval, it will be displayed on the map**.
 
**In this last case and like the user livedemo@mail.com, please, I would appreciate that this one will not be erased**.
 
The map refresh rate is 45 seconds
 
Thanks.
